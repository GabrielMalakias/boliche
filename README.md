 * Create game: After creating the player you can start a game using this endpoint, basically it starts a new game creating frames and all structure needed;
 * Create shot: In order to get the score after all frames you have to input data, through this action you can send how many pins the player knocked down.
 * Show game: To get information like score, current player, frames score and so on.
